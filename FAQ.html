        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Who is invited?</h3>
          <p>If you received an email from us, the invitation is for the people addressed in the email. However, if we neglected to invite your long-term partner, this was likely an oversight. Please let us know if that was the case.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
            <p>Clothing that makes you feel beautiful, and that will be comfortable for dancing. Our only rule is no heels, to protect our toes from getting stomped on. Beyond that, we really, really don't care what you wear, as long as you are happy in it.</p>
            <p>That said, we recognize that some people appreciate having a more concrete dress code, so if you're still not sure what to wear we recommend garden party attire (think florals, jumpsuits, sundresses, colorful patterns). Err on the side of not too fancy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What will the food be like?</h3>
            <p>All food will be vegan, nut-free, and Kosher under the supervision of <a href="http://GoKosher.org">Go Kosher</a>, with a mashgiach onsite through the end of the wedding Sunday night. It will be camp food, so don't expect standard wedding fare. If you have any allergies or other dietary needs, please let us know in your <a href="RSVP.html">form submission</a>.</p>
