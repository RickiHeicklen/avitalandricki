        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Who is invited?</h3>
          <p>If you received an email from us, the invitation is for the people addressed in the email. However, if we neglected to invite your long-term partner, this was likely an oversight. Please let us know if that was the case.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
            <p>Clothing that makes you feel beautiful, and that will be comfortable for dancing. Our only rule is no heels, to protect our toes from getting stomped on. Beyond that, we really, really don't care what you wear, as long as you are happy in it.</p>
            <p>That said, we recognize that some people appreciate having a more concrete dress code, so if you're still not sure what to wear we recommend garden party attire (think florals, jumpsuits, sundresses, colorful patterns). Err on the side of not too fancy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What will the food be like?</h3>
            <p>All food will be vegan, nut-free, and Kosher under the supervision of <a href="http://GoKosher.org">Go Kosher</a>, with a mashgiach onsite through the end of the wedding Sunday night. It will be camp food, so don't expect standard wedding fare. If you have any allergies or other dietary needs, please let us know in your <a href="RSVP.html">form submission</a>.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How should I get to/from the venue?</h3>
            <p>We'll have buses to and from New York City, which anyone is welcome to take. There will also be parking available on campus. If you're interested in carpooling, you can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rg8VPLzS-OLzBX7-Q2uDy67u6Fp1wcH0A9HU7z2s6dg/edit?gid=0#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a> to coordinate with others.</p> 
        </div>
         <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What's the plan for Sunday night?</h3>
          <p>The wedding will wrap up around 9pm, with an afterparty and s'mores around a campfire going late into the night. We'll have buses back to NYC depart from the parking lot at 9pm and 11pm. Guests are invited to stay over in the bunks Sunday night, and join us for breakfast on Monday morning.</p>
